# RocketSeat-Stage3-Responsiveness-Space_Cream

Webpage created for Stage 3 of the RocketSeat Explorer course, focused on responsiveness and use of variables.
This stage introduced, in CSS:
1. Grid layout
2. Transition
3. Animation
4. @keyframes
5. Filter

Based on [this Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/EOSoFqx74zYOmcaSRxL8Dv/Stage-03---Mobile-First-(Copy)?node-id=12%3A137).
I included extra images for better practice.
